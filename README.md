###### On the top right, you have a "Download" button. Just click on it.
### Installation
You'll need Java to be able to run the application.
[Download Java for your configuration](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html "Be careful of the version you need !")
<br>The application is in a simple runnable JAR file. To run it, if you have JVM configured to run them, just double click on the file.
<br> Else, open a command window or a bash, go to the directory where the file is stored :
``cd /path/to/directory``

### How to use SmashRandomizer 
###### *will be updated as new versions are developped, and if I don't, you can spank me with a fish*
When you'll launch the application for the first time, a file named **save.txt** will be generated. It contains your selection, no worries. And you can remove it, the application will regenerate it.
<br>
<br>The application will look like this the first time *to be updated pretty soon, just wait omg*
<br>On the left, you have the full roster (including Miis, yay \o/) on which you can pick characters, and a button to draw a character randomly.
<br>On the right, you'll get the portrait of the character chosen right after you clicked.
<br>
<br>When you click on a charater, their icon will be toggled. If the character is enabled to participate to the, you'll see their portrait displayed. Else, you'll see their silhouette displayed. You can now make your own selection, here's mine for the curious ones.
<br>
<br>When your selection is done, you can now click the button to draw a character within the selection, and **voil√† !** You can now play with your character picked randomly !

### To-do list
* Code the actions the menu will be able to do
* Implements custom presets
* I guess a lot of things, tell me !
